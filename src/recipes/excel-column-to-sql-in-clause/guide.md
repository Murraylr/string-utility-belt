## Why a quick find-and-replace is not enough

Turning a column of values into `IN ('a', 'b', 'c')` looks like a job for one find-and-replace, and for a clean list of ten numbers it is. Real columns are messier. Cells copied from Excel arrive with a trailing space here and a tab there, and on Windows every line ends in a carriage return as well as a newline. Exports repeat the same customer three times. And sooner or later a value contains an apostrophe: the first `O'Connor` in an unescaped list ends the string early, and the query either fails with a syntax error or, worse, runs as something you did not write.

Each of those problems needs its own step, and the order matters. Trimming has to happen before deduplication, or `dana@example.com` and `dana@example.com ` count as two different values. Escaping and quoting happen together, one value at a time, so the quotes the recipe adds are never doubled and the line breaks between values are never escaped as if they were part of one. Blank cells have to be skipped rather than turned into an empty `''` entry that silently matches rows with an empty column.

## What each step does to your data

The [trim each line](/util/trim_lines/) step removes leading and trailing whitespace from every cell, tabs and non-breaking spaces included. Every step splits lines on Windows (CRLF) and Unix line endings alike, so a column copied on Windows works the same way. [Deduplicate lines](/util/line_dedupe/) keeps the first occurrence of each value and drops later repeats. It compares exactly, so `SKU-abc` and `SKU-ABC` both stay: on a case-sensitive collation (PostgreSQL by default) they are different keys, and merging them would quietly drop rows from your result.

The third step runs [SQL escape](/util/sql_escape/) on each line on its own: it doubles each single quote, the standard SQL way to put an apostrophe inside a string literal, and wraps the value in single quotes. Run over the whole column at once, it would put one pair of quotes around everything. [Prefix / suffix lines](/util/line_affix/) then joins the quoted values with commas, skipping blank lines, and a second copy of it wraps the whole list in `IN (` and `)`. Change that last step's prefix to `WHERE email IN (` and the output becomes a complete clause.

## Things to check before you run the query

The escape step uses the standard SQL rule, which is right for PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle and SQLite. MySQL and MariaDB also treat a backslash inside a string as an escape character by default, so there a value ending in a backslash (`C:\Temp\`) swallows its closing quote and breaks the list, and a crafted value can end the list early. For those two, switch step 3's flavor to `mysql`: it escapes backslashes and quotes with a backslash, the way `mysql_real_escape_string` does, so `O'Brien` becomes `'O\'Brien'`. If your server runs with the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode, it reads backslashes literally: keep the standard flavor there. For SQL Server, the `mssql` flavor adds the `N` prefix to any value with characters outside ASCII, as in `N'Müller'`, so the server reads it as Unicode rather than in the database's code page, where characters the code page cannot hold turn into `?`. Values in plain ASCII stay `'…'`. If the values come from other people rather than your own spreadsheet, do not paste them into SQL at all; pass them as query parameters or load them into a temporary table.

If you copied the header cell along with the column, it ends up in the list as a value: delete the first line of the input, or deselect the header before copying. Numeric IDs come out quoted. Most databases cast `'42'` to a number when comparing it with an integer column, but if yours does not, untick wrap in quotes in step 3.

Very long lists have limits. Oracle accepts at most 1,000 expressions in one `IN` list, and every database slows down as the list grows into the thousands. For lists that size, load the values into a temporary table and join against it, or pass them as an array parameter (`= ANY($1)` in PostgreSQL). For a quick one-off query from a spreadsheet, though, this recipe gives you a list that is correct the first time.

## Doing it inside the spreadsheet instead

Excel 365 and Excel 2021 can build a similar list with a formula: `="IN ('" & TEXTJOIN("', '", TRUE, UNIQUE(TRIM(A2:A500))) & "')"`. It is not quite the same. UNIQUE ignores case, so `SKU-abc` and `SKU-ABC` become one value. TRIM removes only ordinary spaces, leaving tabs and non-breaking spaces in place, and it also collapses a double space inside a value, so `Acme  Corp` stops matching. Apostrophes still need wrapping the range in `SUBSTITUTE(…, "'", "''")`. The recipe's steps avoid those differences, can be seen and changed one by one, and nothing you paste leaves your browser.

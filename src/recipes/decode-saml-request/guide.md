title: Decode SAMLRequest and SAMLResponse to Readable XML
description: Paste a SAML redirect URL, a POST form body, a cURL command or a bare SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse value and read it as indented XML, in your browser.

## Why a SAML message takes several steps to read

In SAML 2.0 browser single sign-on, the service provider's request and the identity provider's response both travel through the browser, so when a login fails you can capture them in the network panel (in Chrome DevTools, tick Preserve log first: the flow spans several page loads), but not read them. The HTTP-Redirect binding, which service providers commonly use for an AuthnRequest, compresses the XML with raw DEFLATE (RFC 1951, no zlib header), Base64-encodes the result and URL-encodes that into a `SAMLRequest` query parameter. The HTTP-POST binding, the usual way identity providers deliver a Response, skips the compression: the XML is Base64-encoded into a hidden form field named `SAMLResponse`, and the browser URL-encodes the field when it submits the form. Both are defined in the OASIS [SAML 2.0 bindings specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf).

So one decoder is not enough. A Base64 decoder turns a redirect value into binary noise, because what it decoded is still compressed; an inflate tool that expects a zlib header rejects the raw stream. And the parameter name does not tell you the binding: a `LogoutResponse` sent by redirect is a compressed `SAMLResponse`.

## What each step does, and why in this order

[sed script](/util/sed/) keeps the value of the first `SAMLRequest` or `SAMLResponse` parameter and drops everything around it: the URL or cURL command, `RelayState`, and the `SigAlg` and `Signature` parameters of a signed request. A `SAMLResponse: value` line works too, and a bare value passes through. [url decode](/util/url_decode/) must come before the Base64 step, because `%` is not a Base64 character. It uses `decodeURIComponent`, so a literal `+` stays a `+`; a form decoder such as `URLSearchParams` would read it as a space and corrupt the Base64.

[base64url decode](/util/base64url_decode/) accepts both the standard and the URL-safe alphabet, ignores line breaks, and is set to output bytes. [deflate decompress](/util/deflate_decompress/) could read the Base64 text by itself, but decoding it first lets its condition look at the actual bytes: when they already start with `<`, the message is uncompressed XML, whatever the parameter is called, and the step is skipped. Its format is set to raw, as the Redirect binding requires. Last, [xml pretty](/util/xml_pretty/) indents the XML so each element sits on a line of its own.

## What to check in the decoded XML

In an AuthnRequest, compare the `Issuer` with the entity ID the identity provider has registered for your application, character for character: a trailing slash makes it a different ID. Check `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` against the assertion consumer URLs registered there, and note the request's `ID`, which the response should echo in `InResponseTo`.

In a Response, read the `StatusCode` first. A top-level value other than `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success` means the request failed; a nested code such as `InvalidNameIDPolicy` or `RequestDenied`, and an optional `StatusMessage`, say why. On success, check that `Audience` equals your entity ID, that `Recipient` and `Destination` equal your assertion consumer URL, and that it arrived between the assertion's `NotBefore` and `NotOnOrAfter`: a clock difference between the two servers can put a fresh assertion outside that window.

## What this pipeline does not do

It decodes only the first SAML parameter in the input and checks no signatures. On a signed redirect request the signature is not in the XML but in the `Signature` parameter, computed over the URL-encoded `SAMLRequest`, `RelayState` and `SigAlg` parameters. Pretty-printing changes whitespace, and line breaks inside long text values such as an `X509Certificate` become spaces, so never feed the formatted output to a signature check. An `EncryptedAssertion` stays encrypted, as reading it takes the service provider's private key, and a `SAMLart` parameter (Artifact binding) is only a reference to a message fetched server to server.

It does not parse HTML: from the auto-submitting form of the POST binding, copy just the `value` attribute. If the SAML URL is itself URL-encoded inside another URL, as in a `returnTo` parameter, add a second url decode step at the start. If the inflate step fails on a redirect value, the sender may have written a zlib-wrapped stream (the default of Python's `zlib.compress` and Java's `Deflater`), which a receiver that follows the binding will usually reject too; set the step's format to auto to read it anyway. Decoding runs in your browser, so the message and the personal data in it are not sent to a server.

## The same decode on the command line

For a redirect value, Python's standard library covers all three layers: `python3 -c "import sys,zlib,base64,urllib.parse as u; print(zlib.decompress(base64.b64decode(u.unquote(sys.argv[1])), -15).decode())" 'VALUE'`. The `-15` tells zlib to expect a raw stream with no header. For a POST-binding value, leave out `zlib.decompress` and its `-15`. Pipe either into `xmllint --format -` to indent it. Use `unquote`, not `unquote_plus`, which would turn a stray `+` into a space.

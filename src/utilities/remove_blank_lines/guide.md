title: Remove Blank Lines Online — Strip Empty Lines from Text
description: Remove every empty or whitespace-only line from text online, collapsing a document down to only the lines that actually contain content.
---
## What does this tool do?

This tool deletes every line that is empty or contains only whitespace, keeping every other line exactly as it was. It is a quick way to compact a document that has accumulated stray blank lines — from pasting, exporting, or editing — down to just its actual content.

```example
title: empty and whitespace-only lines are both removed
input: a

b
   
c
output: a
b
c
```

## How it works

The text is split into lines, and each line is checked: if trimming its leading and trailing whitespace leaves nothing at all, the line is dropped; otherwise it is kept **exactly as written**, whitespace and all. The remaining lines are then joined back together with a single newline between them, so removing a blank line closes the gap rather than leaving an empty line behind.

```example
title: a line of only spaces or tabs counts as blank too
input: a
   
	
b
output: a
b
```

A line is judged purely by whether anything survives trimming it — a line that's blank in the middle of the text, at the very start, or at the very end is treated the same way.

```example
title: leading and trailing blank lines are removed along with interior ones
input:

hello

world

output: hello
world
```

## Options

This utility has no configurable options — it always removes every blank or whitespace-only line and leaves every other line untouched.

## Common uses

- Cleaning up text copied from a PDF, web page, or email that leaves extra blank lines behind.
- Compacting a log file, config file, or code listing down to just its non-empty lines before reviewing or diffing it.
- Preparing a word or line list — names, URLs, IDs — for a tool that expects one item per line with no gaps.
- Tidying up the output of another step in a pipeline before it feeds into something line-sensitive, such as a CSV or JSONL parser.

## Tips and pitfalls

- This tool only removes lines that are blank; it does not trim whitespace from the lines it keeps. If a kept line has leading or trailing spaces, use [trim_lines](/util/trim_lines/) as a separate step.
- Removing blank lines is not the same as limiting *how many* blank lines appear — every blank line disappears entirely here, with no gap left behind. If you want to keep single blank lines between paragraphs but collapse runs of several down to one, use [collapse_whitespace](/util/collapse_whitespace/) instead, which limits blank-line runs rather than deleting them outright.
- A line containing only a tab or a run of spaces is blank by this tool's definition even though it is not literally empty, because it checks the line after trimming, not its raw length.
- Since this tool judges each line independently, it works the same regardless of how many blank lines are next to each other, or where in the text they sit.
- For finding and removing duplicate lines rather than blank ones, see [line_dedupe](/util/line_dedupe/).

title: JSON to .env Converter Online
description: Flatten a JSON object into .env KEY=value lines online, with upper-casing, a custom delimiter, and automatic quoting.

## What does converting JSON to .env do?

Configuration often starts as JSON — an API response, a settings file — but
needs to end up as `.env`-style `KEY=value` lines for a shell, a Docker
container, or a dotenv-based app to read. This tool flattens a JSON object
into that format: nested objects become underscore-joined keys, arrays
become indexed keys, and every value is quoted only when it needs to be, so
a dotenv-style parser reads it back as written.

## How it works

1. Only a JSON object at the root is accepted — arrays and scalars at the
   top level are rejected, since there is no key to attach them to.
2. Each nested object is walked depth-first; a key path like `db.host`
   becomes `DB_HOST` (joined with the **path delimiter**, `_` by default).
   An array is walked the same way, with its index as the next path
   segment (`tags.0` → `TAGS_0`).
3. Every path segment is sanitized: each run of characters that are not
   Unicode letters, digits, or underscores is replaced with `_`, so spaces,
   dashes, and dots cannot break the `KEY=value` syntax. Non-ASCII letters
   (`café` → `CAFÉ`) and a leading digit are kept, even though POSIX shells
   only accept ASCII letters, digits, and underscores, not starting with a
   digit.
4. Keys are upper-cased by default (**upper-case keys**); turn this off to
   keep the original casing.
5. **quoting** decides when a value is wrapped in quotes: `auto` (the
   default) quotes only values that need it — those with leading/trailing
   whitespace or shell-significant characters like spaces, `#`, `$`, or
   backticks — `always` quotes everything, and `never` never quotes,
   escaping any embedded newline as `\n` instead so the record still fits
   on one line.

```example
title: flat and nested keys
input: {"port":3000,"debug":true,"db":{"host":"localhost"}}
output: PORT=3000
DEBUG=true
DB_HOST=localhost
```

```example
title: always quote every value
params: {"quote": "always"}
input: {"greeting":"hi there"}
output: GREETING="hi there"
```

A value containing `$` or a backslash is wrapped in single quotes instead of
double quotes when possible (no line break and no `'` in the value), since
single quotes keep `$` and backslashes literal:

```example
title: shell metacharacters stay literal in single quotes
input: {"cmd":"echo $HOME"}
output: CMD='echo $HOME'
```

Characters that are not letters, digits, or underscores are replaced with
`_` in the key name:

```example
title: illegal characters in a key are sanitized
input: {"my key-name":"1"}
output: MY_KEY_NAME=1
```

## Options

- **upper-case keys** — on by default (`PORT`); off keeps the original
  casing (`port`).
- **path delimiter** — the string joining nested path segments, default
  `_` (so `DB_HOST`); set to `__` or anything else you prefer.
- **quoting** — `auto` (default) quotes only values that need it, `always`
  quotes every value, and `never` never quotes (escaping embedded newlines
  as `\n` instead). A dotenv parser reads `never` output back less
  faithfully: that `\n` stays two characters, edge whitespace is trimmed,
  and anything after a ` #` is treated as a comment.
- **export prefix** — off by default; on, prefixes every line with
  `export `, for files that will be sourced by a shell (see the caveat
  below).

## Common uses

- Generating a `.env` file for local development from a JSON configuration
  object.
- Producing environment variables for a CI pipeline, or a
  `docker run --env-file` file, from structured JSON. Docker's env-file
  format takes values literally, quotes included, so use **quoting**
  `never` for it.
- Flattening nested settings (`db.host`, `db.port`) into the flat variable
  names most tools expect.

## Tips and pitfalls

- An empty object, or empty input, produces no output at all — there is
  nothing to write a line for.
- `null` becomes an empty value (`KEY=`): the variable is set to an empty
  string, not left unset.
- The output is not shell-escaped. A double-quoted value can still contain
  `$` (when it also holds a `'`) or backticks, which a shell would expand
  or execute on `source`, and `never` leaves spaces unquoted. Only source
  the result in a shell when you trust every value.
- Different JSON paths can collapse to the same name (`a-b` and `a_b`, or
  `db.host` and `db_host`); both lines are written, and a reader keeps the
  last one.
- [.env to json](/util/env_to_json/) reads the resulting file back into
  JSON, but it parses `.env` literally — `DB_HOST` comes back as a flat
  `"DB_HOST"` key, not nested back under `db.host`, since `.env` has no
  native concept of nesting and this tool's flattening is one-directional.
- For a config format that supports sections natively instead of
  underscore-joined keys, consider [json to ini](/util/json_to_ini/).

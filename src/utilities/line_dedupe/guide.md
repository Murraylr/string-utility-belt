title: Remove Duplicate Lines Online — Line Deduplicator
description: Remove duplicate lines from text online, keeping the first occurrence of each. Optional case-insensitive matching, like the Unix uniq command.

## What does deduplicating lines do?

Given a block of text, this tool removes every line that has already appeared earlier, keeping only the first occurrence of each distinct line and preserving the original order — the same idea as piping sorted or unsorted text through Unix `uniq`, except this tool does not require the input to be sorted first.

## How it works

The input is split into lines on `\n`. Each line is checked against the set of lines already seen: if it is new, it is kept and remembered; if it has been seen before, it is dropped. The surviving lines are joined back together in their original order.

```example
title: default, case-sensitive deduplication
input: a
b
a
c
output: a
b
c
```

Turning off **case sensitive** folds letters to lowercase before comparing, so lines that only differ in capitalization are treated as duplicates and only the first spelling is kept:

```example
title: case-insensitive deduplication keeps the first spelling
params: {"caseSensitive": false}
input: Hello
hello
HELLO
world
output: Hello
world
```

A line that never repeats is left alone, and a block where every line is identical collapses to a single line:

```example
title: no duplicates means no lines are removed
input: a
b
c
output: a
b
c
```

Empty input produces empty output:

```example
title: empty input
input:
output:
```

## Options

- **case sensitive** (`caseSensitive`, default `true`) — when `true`, lines must match exactly, including capitalization, to count as duplicates. When `false`, matching is done on the lowercased line, but the line kept in the output is the first (original-case) spelling encountered.

## Common uses

- Cleaning up a list of URLs, email addresses, or log lines that contains repeats.
- Deduplicating a word or tag list before further processing.
- Removing accidental repeated rows after concatenating several files or exports together.

## Tips and pitfalls

- This tool only recognizes `\n` as a line break. With Windows-style `\r\n` endings the `\r` stays part of each line's content, so the last line (which has no `\r` after it), or any line in a file with mixed endings, will not match its duplicates. Run [normalize line endings](/util/normalize_line_endings/) first to avoid that.
- Blank lines are lines too: only the first empty line is kept, so paragraph breaks after the first one disappear, and if the text ends with a newline after an earlier blank line, that final newline is removed as a duplicate.
- Order is always preserved — the first occurrence of a line is what survives, not necessarily the "best" or most complete one, so if later duplicates carry extra detail you will lose it.
- Whitespace differences count: a line with a trailing space is not considered a duplicate of the same line without one. Run [trim lines](/util/trim_lines/) beforehand if you want to ignore that.
- To sort lines instead of, or in addition to, deduplicating them, see [sort lines](/util/line_sort/), which has its own `unique` option that removes duplicates as part of sorting.

title: JSON Diff Online — Compare Two JSON Documents
description: Compare two JSON documents online and get an added/removed/changed summary, an RFC 6902 JSON Patch, or a unified line diff.

## What does comparing JSON structurally mean?

Running a plain text diff on two JSON documents shows you which *lines* changed, which is misleading once formatting, key order, or line wrapping differ even though the data is the same. A structural diff instead parses both documents and walks them value by value, so it reports exactly which keys were added, which were removed, and which values changed — regardless of whitespace or key order. This tool takes the input as one document and a second document (**compare with**) to diff it against, in one of three output shapes.

## How it works

The default **summary** format reports what changed as a real JSON object, with counts and a list for each kind of change:

```example
title: a changed value and an added key
input: {"a":1,"b":2}
params: {"other": "{\"a\":1,\"b\":3,\"c\":4}", "format": "summary"}
output:
{
  "equal": false,
  "counts": {
    "added": 1,
    "removed": 0,
    "changed": 1,
    "total": 2
  },
  "added": [
    {
      "path": "$.c",
      "value": 4
    }
  ],
  "removed": [],
  "changed": [
    {
      "path": "$.b",
      "from": 2,
      "to": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

Objects are compared key by key: a key present only on one side is an addition or a removal, and a key present on both with a different value is a change. Arrays are compared element by element up to the shorter length, with any extra elements on the longer side reported as additions or removals — an array isn't diffed by matching similar elements, so inserting an item in the middle shows as a cascade of "changed" entries for every shifted position rather than one clean insertion.

### RFC 6902 JSON Patch

**json-patch** format emits the same comparison as a standard [JSON Patch](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902) — a list of `add`/`remove`/`replace` operations with RFC 6901 JSON Pointer paths — that, applied to the input, produces the "compare with" document:

```example
title: emit an RFC 6902 patch
input: [1,2,3]
params: {"other": "[1,5]", "format": "json-patch"}
output:
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/1",
    "value": 5
  },
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/2"
  }
]
```

### Unified diff

**unified** pretty-prints both documents (each with 2-space indentation) and runs a line-based diff over that text, producing familiar `---`/`+++`/`@@` unified diff output with three lines of context around each change — useful when you want a human-scannable diff rather than a machine-readable list of changes. Because it compares text, whitespace in the originals never matters, but key order does: the same keys in a different order show up as changed lines. Identical documents produce empty output:

```example
title: a unified line diff of the pretty-printed documents
input: {"a":1}
params: {"other": "{\"a\":2}", "format": "unified"}
output-matches: ^--- input\n\+\+\+ compare-with\n@@ -1,3 \+1,3 @@\n \{\n-  "a": 1\n\+  "a": 2\n \}$
```

## Options

- **compare with** — the second JSON document to diff the input against (paste it or load a `.json` file); defaults to `{}`, while a field you clear completely is read as `null`.
- **format** — `summary` (default), `json-patch` or `unified`, as above.

## Common uses

- Reviewing exactly what changed between two versions of a config file or API response, independent of formatting.
- Generating a JSON Patch to send only the changed fields to an API that supports RFC 6902.
- Verifying that a transformation pipeline produced the expected output by diffing it against a known-good document.
- Spotting unintended changes in generated JSON, such as build output or a serialized snapshot, across two runs.

## Tips and pitfalls

- In the summary and json-patch formats, two documents that are equal after parsing — regardless of key order or whitespace — report `equal: true` with all counts at zero (or an empty patch, `[]`); reformatting alone is never a change. The unified format is the exception for key order, as noted above.
- Array comparison is positional, not similarity-matched: inserting an element at the start of an array shows every shifted position as changed, plus an addition at the end, rather than one insertion, since there's no reordering heuristic.
- Both documents must be valid JSON (or empty, which is treated as `null`); malformed JSON in either one throws an error naming which side was the problem.
- To keep key order out of a unified diff, run both documents through [json sort keys](/util/json_sort_keys/) first; to extract just one path from a document before comparing it, use [jsonpath query](/util/jsonpath/).
